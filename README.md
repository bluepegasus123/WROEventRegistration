Please download the zip file that I have attached in the email. It contains a script.js file, index.html file, and a tst.csv file. These files are needed to be able to run the program and create the webpage.
Please download Node at this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
Download the 64-bit version that is compatible with your machine - Either Mac or Windows
Download the npm package at this link: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm 
FOR MAC: Please open the “Terminal” application and type “pwd” to see what directory you are in. If you are not in “/Users/user/Downloads”, then type “cd Downloads/src/”.
FOR WINDOWS: Please open Command Prompt or cmd.exe as your “Terminal” application to startup your server.
Go to the src folder which is in “Downloads”. 
Then type in “ls” to see the contents of the src folder. Make sure that “index.html script.js tst.csv” show up as the contents. Then, type in “node -v” and “npm -v” on the next line to make sure that you get a version number for each. Then, please type “sudo npm install http-server -g”. Then, type in “http-server .”, and you should receive the following message below:
